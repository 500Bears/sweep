# Setting up the Sweep CLI

Sweep CLI is a way to try out Sweep without the data entering our servers. It's a great way to get started and see how Sweep works.

<Callout type="info">This is a guide for running the Sweep CLI. To use our hosted version please visit https://github.com/apps/sweep-ai, and to self-host the GitHub App, visit [here](/deployment).</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">Prerequisites: you need Python 3.10 and pip installed, an OpenAI account and a GitHub account.</Callout>

<Steps>
### Install the Sweep CLI

```sh filename="terminal"
pip install sweepai
```

### Initialize the Sweep CLI

Initialize the CLI with your GitHub and OpenAI API keys by running the following command and following the prompts:

```sh filename="terminal"
sweep init
```

### Run the Sweep CLI

Create a GitHub Issue like "Add Sweep to my repo" in your repo, and run the following command:

```sh filename="terminal"
sweep run https://github.com/your-username/your-repo/issues/1
```

Alternatively, if you want to have Sweep automatically fix new issues as they are created, you can run the following command:
```sh filename="terminal"
sweep watch your-username/your-repo
```
</Steps>
